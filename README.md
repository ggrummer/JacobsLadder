Note the Boost Power Module takes 2 months to ship to USA.  Recommend buying more then one.  I've already had one short out on me.

Buy a 1 ft (30 cm) length of gold filled wire (18 or 20 gauge), cut in half (see parts list) and trim as needed.

Two 18650 size LiFePO4 batteries were used in this design.

Original idea from Bitluni
